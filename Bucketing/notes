bucketing along with partitions will be efficient

create table dept_with_location (
    dept_no int,
    emp_name string
    sal int
)
partitioned by (dept string)
clustered by (location) into 4 buckets
row format delmited
fields terminated by ','
lines terminated by '\n'
stored as textfile;

Two bucketed tables can be joined very fast but both the tables are to be bucketed on the joining column
and bucketed into same number of buckets
