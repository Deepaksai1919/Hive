partition column value need not be present in the data for static partition loading

static partitioning is faster than dynamic partition.

hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=strict
will required atlease one static partition in case of multi partitioned tables

If partition is deleted from hdfs, hive metadata will not keep track of those deleted partitions.
It can be corrected using "msck repaiir"

msck repair table table_name;
