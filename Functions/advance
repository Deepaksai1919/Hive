explode(col) will select all elements of arrays in all rows as indevidual rows

with explode we can select only one column.

so lateral view function is introduced

syntax:
col2 is array
col5 is map

select col1, e from table1 lateral view explode(col2) e as e;


select col1, key, value from table1 lateral view explode(col5) e as key,value;


rlike:
will return true or false if there is a pattern matched
syntax:
select 'hadoop' rlike 'ha':
true

if there is null either in column value or match value, the result will be null
