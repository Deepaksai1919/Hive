Deleting db path will not drop database from metadata.
If you use this db and create a table, the db path is also created.


But dropping database will delete the corresponding hdfs path.

set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir;

the above command returns the default database hdfs path

tblproperties ('skip.header.line.count'='1') for skipping header

set hive.cli.print.header=true; to print header

order by vs sort by:

order by uses one reducer and sorts the entire data

but sort by uses multiple reducers and the entire data is not sorted;

set mapreduce.job.reduces=2; -- use this to set 2 reducers and check order by vs sort by

in production, order by has to be used with limit
